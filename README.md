## Mod Details
This is a super small mod (for now) that I created to add certain things I wished were in vanilla Minecraft. I plan to continually add things to this mod that people request, or that I feel are missing from the game. This project is definitely a "kitchen sink" sort of mod (no real theme), but I hope to make up for certain things that minecraft lacks.

## Additions
Here is a list of items my mod currently adds:

### Advanced Grindstone
The Advanced Grindstone is a special type of grindstone that you can craft with a netherite ingot and a regular Grindstone in a smithing table. It is an upgrade (but not a replacement) to the vanilla Grindstone that lets you not only remove all the enchantments from an item, but also curses. You can even just choose one enchantment/curse to remove by using the gui.

## Contributing
I highly encourage anyone who ever sees this mod to send me ideas on what I can add next. Please submit your ideas as an [issue](https://github.com/Ramen5914/Create-Cobblemon-Industrialized/issues) on GitHub and I will mark it as an enhancement. There is a [project board](https://github.com/users/Ramen5914/projects/6) for this repo as well which will show you what I am currently working on for the mod. Another great place to share ideas or talk with me would be on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/Fp7AT6uaD8) or in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Ramen5914/Create-Cobblemon-Industrialized/discussions).
